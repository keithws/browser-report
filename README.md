# browser-report
Report browser settings like [whatsmybrowser.org][1] in a JavaScript object.

Often, when a visitor to your website reports an issue, it can be difficult or impossible to reproduce the same issue without asking your visitor what software and settings they use.

Lately, in this situation, I ask my visitors to send me the report from whatsmybrowser.org. But then, I realized that most of that information is available, via JavaScript, by parsing the user agent when the visitor is submitting their issue. So I set out to create a script that would provide that information.

Note, this is meant for reporting and not for application logic; your application should use feature detection, not browser detection. Therefore, only the most common browser names and OS names are reported, see the [Coverage](#coverage) section below for more details. The full user agent string is always provided and it can help you identify any browser. If you need to report on every browser and OS or other information in the user agent string, then take a look at [platform.js][2] and/or [UAParser.js][7].

# Usage
Package manager support is planned, but for now load this script into a browser and call `browserReport()` with a callback. Note, some values maybe `null` if the information is not available.

## Asynchronous Usage

    <script src="browser-report.js"></script>
    <script>
        browserReport(function (err, report) {
            if (err) {
                throw err;
            }
            console.log(report);
        });
    </script>

## Synchronous Usage

Note, the remote client IP address is not available in the synchronous function call.

    <script src="browser-report.js"></script>
    <script>
        var report = browserReportSync();
        console.log(report);
    </script>

## Report Object Format

The report object has the following keys and value types.

    {
        "browser": {
            "name": (string),
            "version": (string)
        },
        "cookies": (boolean),
        "flash": {
            "version": (string)
        },
        "ip": (string),
        "java": {
            "version": (string)
        },
        "lang": (array || string),
        "os": {
            "name": (string),
            "version": (string)
        },
        "screen": {
            "colors": (number),
            "dppx": (number),
            "height": (number),
            "width": (number)
        },
        "scripts": (boolean),
        "timestamp": (string),
        "userAgent": (string),
        "viewport": {
            "height": (number),
            "layout": {
                "height": (number),
                "width": (number)
            }
            "width": (number),
            "zoom": (number)
        }
        "websockets": (boolean)
    }

# Coverage

The goal is to correctly identify all browsers included on caniuse.com according to their [browser usage table][3]. As of February 11, 2017, their browser usage table accounts for 98.32% of global usage based on data from [StatCounter GlobalStats][4].

If test coverage for operating systems is to meet the same level of coverage as the browsers, it would require __98.32%__ of the [StatsCounter GlobalStats for worldwide market share][8]. Hence the following operating systems should be properly detected:

| OS | % |
|----|---:|
|Android|37.15|
|Win7|18.12
|iOS|13.16
|Win10|12.53
|OS X|5.06
|Win8.1|3.68
|Unknown|2.63
|WinXP|2.18
|Win8|1.15
|Linux|0.78
|Nokia Unknown|0.75
|Windows Phone|0.56
|Series 40|0.46
|WinVista|0.46

Coverage, as of February 11, 2017, matches at __98.32%__

# Benchmarks

The script file size is roughly 3K when gzipped and roughly 2K when uglified and gzipped.
